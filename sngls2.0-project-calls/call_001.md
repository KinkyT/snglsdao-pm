- We can go with SNGLSDAO.io for now, get everything there for now
- Jack preference is SingularDTC.org because of the history of the .com domain

## Marketing // Communication
- We need translations for the website, chinese - set the pipeline for that + community
- Troy insists that we only use the forum and Github as communication
- Jack say the more channels of communication will be created, the better it will be because it can turn into a "growing itself" ecosystem

## Whitepaper

- Board meeting will happen over Zoom
- Lock Joe into providing feedback in that meeting

# Next Steps
