    - Fix the content on the SNGLSDAO

    - There is a process we have to go through before the content can be published
- The 1000 followers mark has been hit — Tyler
    - The cost conversation around $1.50 — we should keep it like this to have quality followers
    - Cranking out content — 20/30% done a skit with Zach
    - Rolling out Podcast, market it on YTUBE and Twitter followers, more likely to consume it if it’s received via an email rather than an ad
