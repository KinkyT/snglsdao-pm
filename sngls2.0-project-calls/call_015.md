## Tech
- Ethereum ecosystem, sharding is being pushed out and the expectation is that the current projects to be compatible — will it be a viable option to keep that implemented?
- Milad: Build with the presumption that layer 1 will not be ready and we should scale on layer 2
- Alex to do some research on the topic
- Over the break multiple sessions of brain storming with Milad and the rest of the development team => decentralize everything in terms of development, have a breakout session next Tuesday
- Alex, the top priority for the dev team is the token swap, schedule finish in Q1, finish the spec by the end of next week or the week afterwards
- Create the specs in the next 10 days, they will be reviewed by Milad

## Marketing US/EU

- 5000 followers on Twitter to be hit, we need to focus on the people we focus

- Crossed 5000 email contacts and slowly try to re-engage the old email community that was interesting in SingularDTV
- Meanwhile we are working with the Breaker marketing app to increase the app installs so it helps SNGLSDAO — create a network effect

## Marketing Asia
- We cannot get verified on Weibo.com, they are agains crypto
- Switch focus on WeeChat for marketing where we got verified
  - Updates regarding changing the listings on different websites such as binance, livecoinwatch, coinmarketcap? 
- Work in progress, multiple websites have been updated already, however places such as coinmarketcap give no response — reaching out to the audience if anyone can help there
- Work on a marketing campaign for the Chinese New Year, do a meetup afterwards for the community to offer updates

## Misc
- Zach has an outline ready to go for the SNGLS DAO treasury — there is some legal items keeping it in place
- 400M founders SNGLS tokens locked for 2 years
- They have been unlocked 16 months ago
- In the process to setup 2 treasuries: SingularDTV and SNGLSDAO
- As soon as the legal work is done, the process to move the tokens to the SNGLSDAO treasury
- Numbers are not well defined yet
- Zach is very interesting in the rollout plan for the token swap — the strategy for the marketing needs to be very well setup up
