## Tech/Marketing

### Proof Systems
- Intro for Tyler Ward, founder and CEO of Proof Systems
- Tyler will be heading the EU, America side of the Marketing plan
- How Jack and Tyler will work together to marry the marketing plans
    - J: Port the content from EU/America, use build communities in Asia
    - Z: Wherever the macro marketing strategy is coming from it will funnel on both sides
    - Z: Find our groove in the next 4 weeks as we generate the marketing assets
    - TW: There is a cultural difference between the geographies — some stuff that doesn’t overlap, however seeing what works in one region it will give you an idea of another region — humans are humans
- Every single dollar that is put in the marketing, KPIs need to be well defined — when it comes on the other end, we know exactly what we did.

### Website updates
- Jack is taking over the development of that
- J: Separate into phases
        - Phase 1 - small intro with link to whitepaper, discord link and videos
        - Phase 2 - the comprehensive website proposed before — analytics information portal => transparency
            - Check screenshot on iphone
            - Should point that the information is coming from the Breaker Dapp
            - This is great information that helps content creators
    - Landing page should look pretty close to where we are trying to get
    - Wordpress?
        - Better if there a simple structure to be put on github and can be easily modified
        - Everyone likes that idea — headless CMS, markdown docs on github
    - Connecting the data from the analytics platform to the website?
        - Integrate with an iframe in the website or through an API
    - Multi language support? Designs are completely different
         - More compact in the Asia market, much more information
    
### Exchange Listings
- Who is handling the token migration wrt exchanges listing?
    - Listed to some people internally, bigger issue dealing with our general councel
    - Z: Q1 2020 conversation, now we need to get the website up, the marketing up in Q4 2019 — not necessary to spent a lot of resources on that
