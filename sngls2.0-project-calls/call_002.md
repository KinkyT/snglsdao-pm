## Tech

#### Stuff from last week
- Hosting this videos on an official DAO channel on Breaker
  - Milad thumbs up
#### Sngls migration code
  - No update yet on 2.0  
  - No updates on the website migration from me
    - We have at least 2 more weeks until the foundation is setup
#### Rebranding the whitepaper
- Troy did some rebranding on there, took all the breaker identity from there, all it needs are some graph updates
- John is working on it, he has all the brand elements from Vlad, he has everything and he will deliver it for tomorrow
- Z: Do we need to put a line item for changes like this, a resource is being allocated?
  - M: Let’s talk more about this while you are in Bucharest, it’s a huge overhead, flat rate
- Jack needs to get the document to format it and come with feedback on how the graphs changes based on that
#### Whitepaper generally
- White paper markdown in github, useful for marketing, needs to be made in chinese
- For asian population is important to make it available on as many platforms as possible — website is very important
- Accessing github in mainland China is not a problem
#### Chinese version of Breaker UI
- Cezar is a little worried is that we won’t be able to get all the metadata translated
- Assess the effort and make a decision and come back next week - Breaker UI and Breaker Pro
- Implement i18n
- Not hard, but it will take priority over the other items, we need to assess effort with the team nonetheless

#### Other
- Board of directors meetings next week, this will not happen
- Add more people to github such as Carl to refrence
- Movie screening during Blockchain week in Japan, talk only about Breaker or include SDTV as well?
  - Makes more sense with time constraint to just keep it focused on Breaker and not mix the two.
