        - To SNGLS 2.0
        - The DAO
        - Start the Ethereum community — OG in the industry, relation with CSYS
        - Educate Breaker followers - break the SDTV twitter from Breaker
   - Tyler going to NY next week to figure out the messaging for the campaign
   - Utilize CodeFund, positive because it’s a very eth centric audience
   - Brave is also a very good place to advertise. 
      - Issue with Brave, as a metric we will have to send them to a specific page for conversion metric.
   - Influencers work better in the East, however we want to leverage in the West, eth community — Podcasts
   - State of the Dapps, very good metrics by analyzing MakerDao— in works to get SDTV there
   - Currently the spreadsheet is to test of the theory, step 1— step 2 is to test the theory, step 3 is to improve this.
