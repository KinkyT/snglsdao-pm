## Tech/Marketing

- Token Migration => Milad, is there a need to have the new SC interact with the old SC?
    - Tokit concern? No concern, SNGLS can be swapped with whatever
    - > Migration of the token can be done quick?
    - The swap contract itself is pretty easy, however we need an UI around it or have instructions
    - Tokit would be a good point on how to start to UI
- Marketing Update China
    - A lot of posts in Waybo (???)
    - Translation is beeing in progress, should be done in 2 days
    - 3000 followers
- Marketing Update US
    - Email templates are in work, GDPR convos with Carl
