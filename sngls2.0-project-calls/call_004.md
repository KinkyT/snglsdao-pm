Zach’s article
	
	Jack
		Started to do the translation
		Jack is curious what Troy meant about mirroring the Ethereum foundation
	Troy
		Ethereum is going to upgrade for 2.0 and will go through a smart contract
		We are going to be mirroring them
		Specifically stating we are going to be mirroring might not be totally necessary
	Jack
		It is going to affect the hour dev timeline
		Telling people we might be doing the upgrade in December
	Troy
		No we won’t be pushing the code till January
		Taxes might be a big reason they are doing everything in January
	Jack
		Exchanges will need to upgrade the code
	Troy
		The idea right now is to use Tokit to do the migration
		The point you made about bringing exchanges on board is a powerful and allows for cheap marketing

	Jack
		Also gives token purchaser who is not very technically advanced the ability to simply upgrade the token.

	Zach
		Using the exchanges makes a lot of sense from a marketing perspective
		Issue will be getting the bandwidth of the devs on the exchanges 

	Jack
		We should get in touch with the exchanges we are listed on right now
		Yobit is for Korea, Binance is good for global, ChaoX
		Principle to find the exchanges who we should collaborate with

	Troy
		Poloniex does smart contract integration
		Bittrex might be a place for it to work

	Zach
		This is a big issue because it requires a lot of lawyers getting involved and drafting opinion letters
		Figuring out who can do this
		
	Kim
		Veronica can get Carl to get all this done
		
	Zach
		We need to identify who can lead the charge on this
		We need someone smooth around the edges who can handle the legality stuff
		
	Cezar
		Can we talk about Breaker DApp
		We need to acquire the content
		Couple months for Podcast functionality
	Zach
		Bandwidth negations are going to happen in Bucharest
		We need to recruit podcasters to come over
		We need to launch our own high quality podcast team
