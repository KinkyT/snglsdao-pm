## Tech
* Plan for next year is to attack the whole build in a compartmentalized development — split up in 3 departments
* Departments work in parallel, but to the same goal to achieve efficiency and keep the overhead at a minimum
* Departments:
    * Content mining — the biggest, hardest
    * Token swap and the DAO work
    * Open source UI, the EtherVision — the dapp but w/o the traditional monetary part so no KYC required, all that stuff
* Hartej intro
    * CEO and co-founder of Zoyko — cyber security and digital product agency
    * Based in Banglor India, Ukraine and Vegas
* Zoyko will be taking over some of the work that Milad and company has been doing
    * Content mining by Milad
    * Token swap/DAO and UI by Zoyko

## Marketing NA/Europe
* Tyler, Twitter, over 3500 followers
* Working on content is the focus to serve the follower base created
* Last week some podcast were worked
* A couple of good podcasts created, not officially release
* Official release will be done on the email marketing campaigns
* Work done on website and email templates
* Email acquisition efforts will start in the next 48h on more mediums than Twitter
* Reallocate Twitter budget to other mediums
* The Twitter following growth should stop — we are using tools to make sure that high quality followers — followers that have multiple interests, DeFi Protocols, DAO Protocols, every single CSYS Spoke, every big Ethereum project <= goal is to let all the community know what the snglsDAO is.
* Next focus is email and content on other mediums
* Which each iteration everything gets better and better, after the NYE, it will be a larger period of time, and the results of this will be even more visible
* Other medium — Facebook page, acquisition on Facebook, Brave
* Even tho crypto hates Facebook, it’s the best medium for demographic marketing specially when you want to get something back such as email for campaign etc
* Facebook is against crypto however you can still talk about topics such as deentralization

## Marketing Asia
* Jack, Weibo.com, in comparison to Twitter or Facebook, is more your target audience engagement driven (?) — gamification content, article publishing, lucky challenge stuff => everything to excite your audiance
* Were are not yet verified by Weibo.com — there are some words that are not allowed such as crypto or blockchain
* The content need to be rewritten to submit the version again — started already on that
* Weibo started 3 weeks ago, goal is to get to the crypto community there which is pretty goad
* There is a strategy in place to get to them, through PMs, get them in and then preset the DAO, get them to the homepage and to follow
* Multiple articles are present on the homepage in different shapes to try to understand what engages the most the audience
* > Updates regarding changing the listings on different websites such as binance, livecoinwatch, coinmarketcap? Comes a lot in the community about that
    * Initial batch has been sent, half of them has been updated to snglsDAO new information
    * However some website are very hard to reach
